Walmart Coding Challenge

##Instalation
npm install
npm start

This project uses react-beautiful-dnd to enable drag and drop functionality.
You can mark a task as complete be moving it into the complete section, or by clicking the checkbox on the task. Conversly, moving from 'Completed' to 'To do' or unchecking the task will mark the task as uncompleted. Either way, these changes will reflect in the components state by altering the task's completed property.
You can also add more tasks by clicking the 'Show More' button. This will add 5 more uncompleted tasks to the To do list, with a max of 20 total tasks available.
